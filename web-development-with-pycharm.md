Web Development with PyCharm
---
In this last and final chapter, we are going to look at the database and framework
support that PyCharm provides out of the box. PyCharm allows you to connect
almost any kind of database, and will automatically download JDBC drivers for you
to act as an interface. It also has support for multiple web frameworks such as Flask,
Django, Pyramid, and GAE. This chapter introduces you to some of the best tools
that PyCharm has to offer for web development. However, this chapter does not
go into great depth; instead it opts to showcase the most useful features. Here is an
outline of what we're going to cover:
- **Database tools: **This section will deal with connecting to databases and using
PyCharm as a complete interface to the database. Please note that, for now,
PyCharm only supports RDBMSes.
- **Web frameworks: **This section will look into the different web frameworks
that PyCharm supports, starting with common tools and then eventually
heading off to framework-specific subtopics.
