Interpreters and Consoles
---
In this chapter, we are going to be diving deep into interpreter support in PyCharm.
PyCharm's interpreter support is very powerful, with the ability to support almost
any interpreter—from the most commonly used interpreter, CPython, to less widely
used interpreters such as PyPy and Jython. PyCharm also has powerful console
support. It can emulate both IPython and the normal Python interpreter, providing
the syntax highlighting and code completion that we take for granted from the
editor. What's even better is that code completion in the console is more powerful
in PyCharm than in the editor. By reading this chapter, you'll be able to quickly
install packages, make virtualenvs, and get the most out of code completion in the
PyCharm console. This chapter is broken down into a few parts:
- All about interpreters: This section covers interpreter configuration,
virtualenv creation, package management, and remote interpreters
- The PyCharm console: This section teaches you how to take advantage of the
PyCharm console—from code completion to debugging
