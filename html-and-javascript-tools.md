HTML and JavaScript Tools
---
PyCharm's support for JavaScript is exclusive to its professional edition. These sets of
tools are common across other IntelliJ IDEs (see Chapter 9, Version Control Integration).
This chapter is by no means exhaustive because most of the support for JavaScript
in PyCharm comes from plugins. If we were to dive into all the plugins available for
IntelliJ IDEs, we would've written several books on the topic. So, to keep this short
and sweet, these are some of the most used features that any JavaScript developer
would find useful. Here is a quick run-down of what we're going to cover:
- **JavaScript support:** This section of the chapter is the largest and covers
many features that developers would find useful. We are going to look at
JavaScript code completion, NodeJS support, library support (for libraries
such as jQuery and  underscore ), transpiled language support, and code
quality tools such as JSLint. This section is rather large, so it's been broken
down into much smaller subsections for your convenience.
- **HTML and CSS: **This section deals with support for HTML, CSS, Emmet,
and live editing, as well as transpiled CSS languages such as SASS and Less
and transpiled HTML languages such as HAML. We are also going to take
a quick look at watchers and how they can make the task of compiling these
files much simpler.
