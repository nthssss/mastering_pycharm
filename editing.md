Editing
---
Editing is what we are going to be doing the most in PyCharm, and hence, this is
one of the most important chapters. This chapter does not try to cover a wide range
of feature sets; it instead tries to provide a comprehensive look at some of the best
tools available for editing. The most important part of this chapter is enhancing
code completion in PyCharm. This IDE has a remarkably powerful engine that can
understand your code, and it allows for things such as better code completion (even
when we haven't specified the types), method hierarchies, and a lot more.
This chapter has several parts:
- **Improving code completion:** This section will take a comprehensive look at
the tools at our disposal that enhance PyCharm's code completion, giving us
more completion options and smarter completions.
- **Writing code:** This section will cover some of the best tools that PyCharm
offers to write code quickly and effectively.
- **Setting up IPython Notebook:** IPython Notebook has become the de facto
document format for Python's scientific community, and for good reason.
This section will take a look at how to set up IPython Notebook in PyCharm
so that we can get the benefits of code completion inside the notebook.
- **Editor plugins:** This section will cover a few select plugins to help you get
used to PyCharm if you come from other editors such as Emacs and Vim.
This section will also showcase support markdown.
- **Reading code:** This section looks at the different tools at your disposal to
better read code such as diagrams and method hierarchies.
