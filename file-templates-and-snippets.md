File Templates and Snippets
---
> _"Are we there yet?"â€“ Everyone, including you_

Coding is a ton of fun, but sometimes, it can be rather repetitive. Snippets (live
templates) in PyCharm help you do away with a lot of the receptive parts. However,
PyCharm goes further; it even allows you to make file templates so that once you
make a new file, for example, a  .py file or a  .js file, you can have some boilerplate
code written for you. You're already using file templates in PyCharm if you haven't
changed its default settings. This chapter is all about coding speed, so hold on to
your hats!
In this chapter, we are going to take a look at:
- File templates
- Snippets (live templates)
- Surround templates
