Version Control Integration
---
> "As a project drags on, my git commit messages get less and less informative."
â€“ Randall Munroe

A lot of my friends use IntelliJ IDEs and hence, have forgotten how to use most Git
command-line tools. I can't blame them; the interface that we have is very simple
to use, and most of the common commands are available to us in a neatly packed
menu. That isn't to say that this layer of abstraction like many others is leaky. In this
chapter, I will take a quick look at most of the tools and talk about some limitations.
Version control is in no way a simple topic and hence, I won't explain its topics; I'll
merely show you how to use the tools available in PyCharm. We will mainly go over:
- Initializing version control
- Ignoring files
- Adding remotes
- The VCS menu
- The Changes panel
- Change lists
