Understanding the Keymap
---
The keymap is one of the most powerful features that PyCharm has to offer. It allows
you to set your keyboard shortcuts and find the keyboard shortcuts you've seen
other people use. It also allows you to use a familiar set of keyboard shortcuts that
you're used to such as Eclipse and Emacs. This chapter is very much a standalone
chapter, and if you understand how keymaps work, you're well on your way to
using the most powerful features that PyCharm has to offer with ease.
In this chapter, we are going to go over the following topics:
- **Different keymaps:** PyCharm assumes that you might have had prior
experience with a separate IDE or editor, so you can quickly adapt
PyCharm to predetermined keyboard shortcuts.
- **Finding shortcuts:** A lot of times, you will see other people using
keyboard shortcuts, but you won't know what they're called. This
section will remedy that.
- **Setting shortcuts:** We will customize our own keyboard and mouse shortcuts
as we see fit. We will also make our own abbreviations.
- **Troubleshooting on Mac:** Unlike Windows and Linux, Mac comes with
support for a lot of special characters that can get in the way of using
keyboard shortcuts. This section will remedy that problem.
