Getting the Right Look
---
> _"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."– Leonardo da Vinci_

I fell in love with Python for its elegance. I love how there are no semicolons, how
you can make a block through a simple indentation, how you can make multiline
strings without having to concatenate them, and how you can make lambdas in a
single line. I love how readable it all is, and how the documentation (docstrings) is
built right into the language.
I think we all appreciate beauty. Think about it; you have a favorite font, a favorite
color-scheme, and the list can go on. In essence, the code you write needs to be
beautiful in your perspective, not just the syntax, but how it looks—the colors,
the font, the highlighting—everything must be just right.
In this chapter, we are going to work toward making PyCharm beautiful. We'll
progress from changing the overall appearance to some of the predefined
appearances available to us on PyCharm. After that, we'll get into fonts and how the
highlighting/coloring works in PyCharm. With the most difficult part of this chapter
under our belt, we'll dive into exporting and importing styles and themes.
If you appreciate how your code looks and how you can make it as beautiful as
possible, then this chapter will equip you with all the things necessary to make
PyCharm as vibrant as you want it to be. I've tried to make this chapter light so that
you can experiment yourself with it, and most things are pretty self-explanatory.
