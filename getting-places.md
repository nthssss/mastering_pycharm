Getting Places
---
This chapter is all about navigation. It is divided into three parts. The first part is
called Omni, which deals with getting to anywhere from any place. The second is
called Macro, which deals with navigating to places of significance. The third and
final part is about moving within a file and it is called Micro.
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to navigate freely and quickly within
PyCharm, and use the right tool for the job to do so.
Veteran PyCharm users may not find their favorite navigation tool mentioned or
explained. This is because the methods of navigation described throughout this
chapter will lead readers to discover their own tools that they prefer over others.
