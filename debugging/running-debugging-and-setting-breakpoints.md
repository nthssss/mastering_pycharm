Running, debugging, and setting breakpoints
---
You can run a  .py file in two modes: running and debugging. If you run a program,
then even if you set breakpoints (points at which PyCharm will stop program
execution), nothing will happen. It's only when you run it in debug mode that
breakpoints become effective. The way I like to run or debug my programs is
through the **Resume Program** action:

You can then choose any of the different ways to run/debug your program. By
default, if you press Enter, you will go into debug mode, if you press Shift + Enter,
the program will just run. You can also choose coverage by pressing the left arrow:
