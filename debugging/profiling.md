Profiling
---
Profiling is a new addition to PyCharm 4.5, and has a nice set of features, most
notably, a graphic representation of the calls made. We are going to use the
previously mentioned _downloader.py_ file to demonstrate some of the new features.

We simply right-click anywhere on the file and then left-click on **Profile'downloader'**. With this, we will be taken to a new panel that shows us a call table.
